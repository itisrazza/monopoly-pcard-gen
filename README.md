# Property Card Generator

Here's a Python script I've come up with to generate property cards for custom Monopoly games.

Download the repo, install [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) and have fun.

Properties are read in from [`properties.csv`](properties.csv) and dropped into the [`output`](output) folder.
